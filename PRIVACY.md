# Tro privacy policy

Effective date: August 25, 2026

Tro is an open-source desktop agent. It can answer requests with a hosted
model and, when the user asks, observe and control applications on the user's
computer. This policy describes the network transfers made by the application
and the data stored locally or by an operator-configured service.

## Data sent to service providers

Tro transfers data only for configured application features or actions the
user requests:

- **Tro hosted API on Railway:** production builds send the verified Google
  ID token once during sign-in, then send an opaque device-session token with
  model, voice, and companion-speech requests. The API stores the Google user
  ID, email, display name, session expiry, and only an HMAC digest of the device
  token in PostgreSQL. It proxies task content, observations, tool results,
  Realtime SDP, and short speech text to the providers below but does not store
  those request or response bodies. Railway processes standard network and
  service logs; Tro application logs exclude tokens and task content.

- **OpenAI:** typed task text, conversation messages, model tool results, and
  desktop observations needed for a task can be sent to the Responses API.
  Desktop observations can include screenshots and visible text. Push-to-talk
  audio is sent to OpenAI Realtime for transcription. If an eligible user
  explicitly generates a custom cursor companion, the selected source image,
  their customization prompt, and the generated image output are processed by
  the OpenAI Images API. Tro's hosted API handles those bodies in bounded
  request memory but does not persist or log them. Responses requests set
  `store: false`. Companion image generation is enabled only when the operator
  confirms Zero Data Retention (ZDR) for the exact OpenAI project and key used
  by the service. ZDR removes normal customer-content retention for eligible
  calls, but OpenAI may retain images flagged for child-safety review. OpenAI's
  service terms and retention rules still apply. See the
  [OpenAI privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/).
- **Google:** when the user chooses Google sign-in, Tro sends the OAuth
  authorization request and receives verified identity claims and tokens. The
  application requests only OpenID, email, and profile scopes. See the
  [Google privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **PostHog:** analytics is disabled unless an operator configures a PostHog
  project token. When enabled, Tro sends app/platform/version fields,
  anonymous or signed-in identifiers, sign-in profile fields, task lifecycle
  counts, tool identifiers/operations, and voice-transcript character counts.
  It does not send task text, screenshots, URLs, document contents, file paths,
  tool arguments, or voice-transcript content to PostHog. GeoIP collection and
  automatic exception capture are disabled. See the
  [PostHog privacy policy](https://posthog.com/privacy).
- **ElevenLabs:** when an operator configures ElevenLabs companion speech,
  the short visible text of each grounded guidance step is sent for
  text-to-speech generation. Generated audio is streamed to the current
  guidance window and is not persisted by Tro. Clarification, approval,
  internal action, observation, and final-response text is not sent to
  ElevenLabs for narration. See the
  [ElevenLabs privacy policy](https://elevenlabs.io/privacy-policy).
- **GitHub and Electron's update service:** installed builds contact the fixed
  Tro GitHub release feed to check for, download, and install application
  updates. Standard request metadata such as IP address and user agent can be
  processed by those services. See the
  [GitHub privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).
- **User-selected websites and applications:** when the user asks Tro to
  navigate, type, upload, submit, or otherwise act in a third-party service,
  that service receives the information involved in the requested action under
  its own privacy policy. Consequential actions require confirmation in the
  cases enforced by Tro's host policy.

## Data stored by Tro

- Google and hosted device-session data is encrypted with the operating
  system's secure storage. Signing out revokes the server session and deletes
  the saved local session.
- Preferences, membership state, and a random analytics installation ID are
  stored locally in the Electron application-data directory.
- Task history is persisted only when the operator configures `DATABASE_URL`.
  It stores task requests, conversation messages, goal data, and lifecycle
  events under the verified Google user ID. Raw screenshots, OAuth tokens, and
  model-provider credentials are not stored in task history.
- Screenshots used during a task are kept in the active in-memory execution
  context and are not part of the persistent task-history schema.
- A generated companion remains in memory as a short-lived preview until the
  user activates it or it expires. The activated 128-pixel PNG is encrypted by
  the operating system through Electron `safeStorage` and stored under a
  one-way hash of the signed-in account ID. The source image and prompt are not
  stored. **Use default companion** deletes that account's active local image;
  signing out immediately returns the interface to the bundled default and
  prevents another account from reading the signed-out account's image.

The retention and deletion policy for an operator-configured PostgreSQL or
PostHog deployment is controlled by that operator. To request deletion from a
Tro-operated deployment, contact the address below with the Google account
email used to sign in.

## Security

The Electron renderer is sandboxed. OAuth and device tokens remain in the
trusted main process behind validated IPC contracts. Provider and hosted
database credentials remain in Railway and do not enter the desktop build.
Credentials are not intentionally included in analytics or release artifacts. See the
[security model](docs/security.md) for implementation details.

## Contact and changes

Privacy questions and deletion requests can be sent to
[danielbaker06072001@gmail.com](mailto:danielbaker06072001@gmail.com). Material
changes to this policy will be published in this repository with a new
effective date.
